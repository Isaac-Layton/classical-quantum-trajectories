Having done this, we may plot the relevant trajectory in phase space and Hilbert space using a suitable representation such as the Bloch sphere. Since it is not necessary for high numerical accuracy to understand the behaviour of these toy systems, we will assume that provided the trace of the quantum system is close to 1 the numerical model is behaving suitably well â€“ in most cases this can be simply verified by looking at the path of the trajectory in Hilbert space."
