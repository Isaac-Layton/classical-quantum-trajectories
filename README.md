# Classical-Quantum Trajectories
Basic code to simulate the trajectories of interacting classical and quantum systems

## Overview
Code and comments in Jupyter notebook format to simulate the toy models found in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11722](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11722)
 
Toy models include:
1. a linear interaction 
2. a non-linear potential with phase space dependent diffusion
3. a massive superposition 
4. n qubits on a 1D lattice 

Trajectories are generated by an Euler-Maruyama method and then plotted in phase space/ a Bloch sphere representation. 

## Repurposing the code

Optional parameters to the functions `______Dynamics()` include the initial conditions, relative size of decoherence and an option to simulate the standard semi-classical results. The dynamics may also be directly changed by editing the numerics part of each function. When changing from the defaults, it is sensible to plot the norm (and determinant, if a 2x2 density matrix) to check the numerical accuracy of the dynamics.
